This is an application for my own learning purposes to learn native android java development.

## Features so far include

  ```
  Access to storage (separate activities for music player and storage access part);
  ```
  ```
  Locating and playing audio files (utilizes mediaplayer library, created recursive storage scraper to find all audio);
  ```
  ```
  Retrieving and setting metadata (audio image, title, artist and etc.);
  ```
  ```
  Creating playlists;
  ```
  ```
  Dialogs with basic animations for playlist creation;
  ```
  ```
  Recyclerview views with adapters for playlists and storage.
  ```

## Working on

  ```
  Saving playlists on sqlite;
  ```
  ```
  Creating fragments to display music items inside playlists, favorites and etc.
  ```
  
## Planning on:
 
  ```
  Implementing notifications, equalizer, bluetooth responses;
  ```
  ```
  Learning spring boot to be able to create web APIs, in this case storing and retrieving music.
  ```
