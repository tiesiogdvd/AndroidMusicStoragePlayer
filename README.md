# AndroidMusicStoragePlayer
This is an application for my own learning purposes.

Features so far include:
  access to storage (separate activities for music player and storage access part);
  locating and playing audio files (utilizes mediaplayer library, created recursive storage scraper to find all audio);
  retrieving and setting metadata (audio image, title, artist and etc.);
  creating playlists;
  dialogs with basic animations for playlist creation;
  recyclerview views with adapters for playlists and storage.

Working on:
  saving playlists on sqlite;
  creating fragments to display music items inside playlists, favorites and etc.
  
Planning on:
  implementing notifications, equalizer, bluetooth responses;
  learning spring boot to be able to create web APIs, in this case storing and retrieving music.
