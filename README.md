# AndroidMusicStoragePlayer
##This is an application for my own learning purposes.

##Features so far include:
   ###Access to storage (separate activities for music player and storage access part);
  ###Locating and playing audio files (utilizes mediaplayer library, created recursive storage scraper to find all audio);
  ###Retrieving and setting metadata (audio image, title, artist and etc.);
  ###Creating playlists;
  ###Dialogs with basic animations for playlist creation;
  ###Recyclerview views with adapters for playlists and storage.

##Working on:
  ###Saving playlists on sqlite;
  ###Creating fragments to display music items inside playlists, favorites and etc.
  
##Planning on:
  ###Implementing notifications, equalizer, bluetooth responses;
  ###Learning spring boot to be able to create web APIs, in this case storing and retrieving music.
